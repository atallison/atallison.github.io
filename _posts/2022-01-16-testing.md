# A New Start

For over ten years I spent good money on a hosting site and a domain name in order to maintain a blog where I kept all of my stupid thoughts and feelings for no one in particular to read. I finally did the bare minimum of work and cancelled that subscription and found that I can host a blog on here for free! So I'm going to just use this. I may try to populate the content from the old blog on here some time and this may not last all that long, but at least this time it's not burning a hole in my wallet.
