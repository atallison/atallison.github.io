# Solving Sudoku with a Single SQL Query

I've seen a couple examples of using SQL to solve sudoku puzzles, but most of the ones I've seen have used loops or cursors to cycle through and create a correct answer. I feel like if you make a solution that's procedural like that, you might as well have done it in a language that is designed to be procedural. The real trick is to write a query that really makes use of a relational database's parallel projection capabilities to solve a sudoku challenge.

We'll start with this fairly simple sudoku puzzle.

## The Solution

For those looking for a tl;dr, here is the complete solution for solving a sudoku puzzle with a single query. The first two query simply define and populate the given values of a puzzle, then the last query evaluates and returns a solved sudoku grid. I'll be posting a couple more times with in depth looks at various sections of the query.

```sql
DECLARE @given AS TABLE (Row INT, Col INT, Data INT);

INSERT  INTO @given
        (Row, Col, Data)
VALUES  (2, 1, 9), (3, 1, 2), (4, 1, 5), (6, 1, 6), (8, 1, 3),
        (9, 1, 8), (5, 2, 1), (6, 2, 3), (8, 2, 2), (4, 3, 2),
        (8, 3, 4), (9, 3, 6), (2, 4, 3), (5, 4, 8), (6, 4, 1),
        (7, 4, 2), (3, 5, 8), (5, 5, 9), (7, 5, 4), (3, 6, 7),
        (4, 6, 4), (5, 6, 5), (8, 6, 6), (1, 7, 3), (2, 7, 5),
        (6, 7, 8), (2, 8, 4), (4, 8, 1), (5, 8, 6), (1, 9, 8),
        (2, 9, 2), (4, 9, 7), (6, 9, 4), (7, 9, 5), (8, 9, 1);
